# Hobobot
Hobobot is a bot written using the Node.js module Discord.js. 

It mainly contains some useful commands and inside jokes for the gaming community that I frequent. 

Code in this repo is not pretty, and not well formatted. The bulk of this bot was written on the fly, while I was self teaching myself Javascript. While this bot is live on a Digital Ocean Droplet, I am not confident that it would be a simple pull and install project at this point.

I have stopped new development on the bot until I can rewrite it for V2.0, and plan to include a web interface for managing custom per server commands at that time. 

### So acknowledging that this code would best be served with some parmesan and garlic bread, what can it do?

* Music! The bot can connect to a discord voice channel and stream songs from youtube queries. 
  ```
  ++join : "Join the voice channel the message sender is currently in"
  ++add : "Add a song to the playlist, usage: '++add Reptilia The Strokes', this will search YouTube and add the first result to the playlist."
  ++playlist : "Shows the first 15 songs on the current playlist."
  ++play : "Plays the current playlist, if bot is in a voice channel"
  ++shuffle : "Shuffles the playlist"
  ++leave : "Clears the playlist and leaves the voice channel"

  While music is playing:
  ++pause : "Pauses the music"
  ++resume: "Resumes the music"
  ++skip : "Skips the current song"
  ++time : "Shows the playtime of the current song"
  volume+(+++): "Increases the volume by 5% per +"
  volume-(---): "Decreases the volume by 5% per -"
  ```
* Custom commands, various things that users requested to be attached to their tags, usually image replies or text replies.
* D&D Dice Rolling! You can enter commands such as $roll 3d20k1 to roll 3 d20's keeping the top 1 roll. 
* Urban Dictionary lookups - query the Urban Dictionary API. 
* YouTube lookups, return the top result for your query.
* Weather lookups, return the current weather in whatever city you enter. 
* Wikipedia lookups, return the top wikipedia result for your query. 
* Oxford Dictionary lookups, returns the definition for your query.
* 8Ball - get a random 8Ball response! 
* Kick and Ban users
* Stock data - ex. $stock AAPL - No API here, the bot will scrape data from Google Finance and return current value. 
* Twitch notifications, watches guild members and alerts a specified channel if one starts streaming on Twitch.

### What would I improve?
